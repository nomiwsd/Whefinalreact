WHE may exercise judgment in allowing or disallowing certain assets, listings, smart contracts, and collections consistent with the spirit of openness in a worldwide community of users of a radical new technology. We carefully consider the complete situation and all its details in light of our policies before deciding to remove inappropriate assets, listings, smart contracts, and collections when we discover them, or they're brought to our attention.

Assets, listings, smart contracts, and collections that WHE deems inappropriate, disruptive, or illegal are prohibited on WHE. WHE reserves the rights to determine the appropriateness of listings on its site and remove any listing at any time. If you create or offer an asset, listing, smart contract, or collection in violation of these policies, we will take corrective actions, as appropriate, including but not limited to removing the asset, listing, smart contract, or collection, deleting your WHE account, and permanently withholding referral payments and developer revenue sharing fees. WHE cannot destroy or impound your assets or smart contracts, but we reserve the right to destroy inappropriate metadata stored on our servers.

Assets, listings, smart contracts, and collections that include metadata that violates international or intellectual property laws, promotes suicide or self-harm, incites hate or violence against others, degrades or doxes another individual, depicts minors in sexually suggestive situations, or is otherwise illegal are prohibited on WHE and will be removed.
