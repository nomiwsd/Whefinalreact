              NFTs prove ownership of a unique digital asset like art, music,
              collectibles, videos, or anything else with blockchain technology,
              if you buy a physical painting, you know it’s real because you see
              the artist’s signature on the canvas. Somebody can photocopy the
              painting, but they don’t own it you do. Before NFTs, digital
              assets were like photocopies: When you buy a WHE Club NFT, the
              artwork is yours to keep or use in advertising, whether you plan
              to sell it or not.
